# Browser Technologies

> One of the most beautiful principles of the web is that it's for everyone. Anyone with a computer and a browser should be able to use the web. The web is no controllable environment. You can be pretty sure that no one will see and interact with a website the same as you. Things like the browser dimensions, display dimensions, way of interaction, hardware quality, network quality and more have an impact on the way we view websites.

> In this course we're going to learn how to build websites from the ground up in a progressively enhanced way to make sure that anyone can use our website.

# Week 1

In the first week our assignment we needed to break the web.

In the second assignment we needed to fork our project we made in the last week. However, I made a [virtual reality](https://github.com/Mimaaa/MINOR_WD_PROJECT1) demo and it's not really practical to research that project. Instead, I used the [CMD Amsterdam website](https://cmd-amsterdam.nl) to test certain features.
