## What is FlexBox?

"CSS Flexible Box Layout is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions."

## Fallback

### blocks & floats

In case of an old browser, the browser will not read the flex element that's set on the article, but the block element instead. In order to replicate the same flex function, all the sections have a left float.
